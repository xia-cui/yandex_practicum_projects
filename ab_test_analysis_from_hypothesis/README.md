The notebook and html present the analysis of an A/B test results for an online store. 

9 hypotheses were first examined to decide which ones to prioritize, following which the analysis of A/B test results focuses on comparing the cumulative revenue, average order size, and conversion rates between the two groups.

4 statistical significance tests, using both raw data and data removed of anomalies, were carried out to see if the A/B have the same conversion rates and average order size. Recommendations were given on whether to continue the test.
