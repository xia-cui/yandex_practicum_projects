# A/B test analysis for an online store
The goal of this analysis is to determine if a new recommender system will change the customer conversion rate at each stage of the sales funnel (→product_page → product_cart → purchase) within 14 days of signing up. 

A key aspect of the project is also to assess the viability of carrying out an A/B test analysis given the group size. 

Readers of the project might also find using sankey diagram to visualize user journey helpful and can modify the codes for their own use.
